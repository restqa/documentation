Hello Everyone,
We are finally getting there, after :

* A few years of thinking
* A few month of building
* A few weeks of stress

I'm really proud of this new product : RestQA!

## What is RestQA ?

RestQA is simply an Open Source API Automation testing ecosystem, allowing anyone to get a api test automation pipeline ready in less than 1 minutes!
Starting from the test suite until the setup of the continuous integration, you will be able to get your api test with automation without the support of any developer or devops.

## Why RestQA ?

As a consultant, to keep each mission exciting i'm challenging myself to get a daily release cycle. Then in order to release every day there is 2 main pilars : Devops Automation and Testing Automation.
While Devops Automation is more a human challenge that vary from mission to another, Testing Automation is almost the same pain everytime:

1. Share the vision of full speed testing automation
2. Reassure the local QA, let them feel that it's gonna be cool
3. Build the engine with the Dev Team
4. Setup the pipeline with the devops
5. Get into a full team learning curve

Only 5 steps but the reality is that... On some mature teams it can take weeks, but most of the time takes months ... and months...

> An any automation lover would understand : "Automating  the  pain is the best thing on earth"

On that process i start looking for any project or product that can do the job, But i realized  that in fact there is not a lot of choices :

* Saas Product (assertible, rainforst QA, etc..)
* Community tools (postman, soapUI, RestAssured, various open source projects)

### Saas Products

#### Pros

* Advance feature for a lot of different us cases
* Automation pipeline managed by the product
* Integrates to a lot of different tools
* Reliable
* Good documentation
* Support

#### Cons

* Price
* Learning curve for the local team
* Proprietary: we don't own the software or the Test scenario...
* Strong lock in: If you want to stop your subscription, your product won't have test anymore

### Community Tools 

#### Pros

* Free
* Driven by the community
* A lot of flavor
* Good documentation
* Low learning curve for the local team
* Reliable
* No lock in : You own your tests

#### Cons

* No Support
* No framework for the team to follow.
* Team needs to build the entire automation pipeline 


This is why i decided to build RestQA because i couldn't find any tool that would give me the entire ownership of my test scenario and the Automation pipeline required to boostrap faster.

##  Open Source First !

It's all about knowledge sharing, the vision is to build quality api around the world.
However it was a natural choice to open the source of RestQA, since it is based on cucumber which is  popular open source project. And i try to build is just a way to help anyone to boostrap their API test automation on a modular and efficient way.
It might not be perfect but i'm sure a few people will support on fixing the missing pieces

## RestQA Learning Curve

In fact RestQA is easy to use, 2 file in your repository and it runs !
Howver the key challenge will remain on the Test Scenario creation, depending on the knowledge of the QA or the dev this step learning phase might be different.

## Key differienciator

RestQA is Open, if you are coming from a engineering background you can just intall it manually in your project and get automation, monitoring or alerting within a few minutes. Or If your not an engineer freak you can just connect to  [get.restqa.io](https://get.restqa.io), where the user can manage everything from a nice user interface.

## Premium feature

Actually using RestQa is totally free, it's unlimited run, unlimited installation, use it as you want.
As premium feature we are simply proposing different kind of support :

* Setup support : Anything related to the RestQA tool
* Test Scenario Contribution : You might required some support to accelerate, share your requirements and we automate the tests for you
* Product behavior analysis: We have different Artificial intelligence model that could analyze  the result of your test and give your recommendation on different area such as : security, consistency, Coverage, etc...



I hope those few words helps you to understand a little bit more from where RestQA is comming from and where it is aiming.
